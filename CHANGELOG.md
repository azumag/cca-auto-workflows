## Upgrade Notes

### From 1.x to 2.0.0

1. **New Dependencies**: The enhanced CI pipeline requires no additional setup but provides much more comprehensive testing
2. **New Monitoring**: System health checks will start automatically and create alerts as issues when problems are detected
3. **Enhanced Security**: New security scans may identify existing vulnerabilities that should be addressed
4. **Performance**: Workflows should run faster due to caching and parallel execution
5. **Troubleshooting**: Enhanced documentation provides better support for common issues

### Recommended Actions After Upgrade

1. Review any system health alerts that may be generated
2. Check the new security scan results in the Security tab
3. Update any custom workflow configurations to take advantage of new features
4. Review and update repository secrets as recommended in the security best practices
5. Consider enabling additional monitoring alerts based on your usage patterns

### Breaking Changes

- None. All existing functionality remains compatible.
- New workflows are additive and do not affect existing automation.

### Migration Guide

No migration steps required. The system improvements are backward compatible and enhance existing functionality without breaking changes.
