## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Basic understanding of GitHub Actions and YAML
- Claude Code CLI (for testing Claude interactions)
- Git command line tools

### Development Environment

This project consists primarily of:
- GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
- Markdown documentation
- Configuration files for various tools

No complex build process or runtime environment is required.

## Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   gh repo fork azumag/cca-auto-workflows
   ```

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cca-auto-workflows.git
   cd cca-auto-workflows
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies** (optional)
   ```bash
   npm install -g markdownlint-cli
   npm install -g markdown-link-check
   pip install yamllint
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Code Quality Standards

### YAML Workflows

- Use 2-space indentation
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices
- Include descriptive names for all jobs and steps
- Use `continue-on-error: true` for non-critical steps
- Add proper permissions declarations
- Include timeout settings for long-running jobs

**Example:**
```yaml
name: Example Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write

jobs:
  example:
    name: Example Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### Markdown Documentation

- Follow the existing markdownlint configuration
- Use ATX-style headers (`#` instead of `===`)
- Keep line length under 120 characters
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use relative links for internal references

### Configuration Files

- Validate JSON files before committing
- Use consistent formatting and indentation
- Include comments where helpful
- Follow the established patterns in existing config files

## Testing

### Local Validation

Before submitting a pull request, run these checks:

```bash
# Validate YAML files
yamllint .github/workflows/

# Check markdown formatting
markdownlint .

# Validate JSON files
for file in *.json; do python -m json.tool "$file" > /dev/null; done

# Check markdown links
find . -name "*.md" -exec markdown-link-check {} \;
```

### Workflow Testing

- Test workflow changes in your fork before submitting
- Ensure workflows don't fail due to missing secrets or permissions
- Use `continue-on-error: true` for steps that might fail in forks
- Document any required secrets or setup steps

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Test your changes thoroughly**
   - Run local validation scripts
   - Test workflows in your fork if applicable
   - Verify documentation is accurate and up-to-date

2. **Follow commit conventions**

   # Examples of good commit messages
   git commit -m "feat: add new workflow for dependency updates"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with label processing"
   git commit -m "docs: update contributing guidelines"
   git commit -m "ci: improve error handling in validation jobs"
   ```

3. **Update documentation**
   - Update README.md if adding new features
   - Document any new configuration requirements
   - Include examples for new workflows or features
