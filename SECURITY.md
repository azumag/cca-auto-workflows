# Security Policy

## Security Quick Start üî¥ CRITICAL

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRIORITY**: These items must be implemented before production deployment

For immediate security, focus on these critical items first:

### 1. Token and Secret Management
- **Never commit secrets or credentials** to the repository
- Store all tokens and API keys in GitHub repository secrets
- See **Secret Management** section below for detailed implementation

### 2. API Security Setup
- Ensure all API calls use HTTPS
- Store Claude Code OAuth tokens as repository secrets  
- See **API Security** section below for complete setup guide

### 3. Vulnerability Reporting Process
- Set up security advisory reporting through GitHub Security tab
- Never report vulnerabilities through public issues
- Establish 48-hour acknowledgment timeline

**Implementation Timeline**: Complete within 1-2 days before any production use.
**Verification**: Run security checklist in Phase 1 implementation section below to confirm completion.

## Reporting a Vulnerability üî¥ CRITICAL

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRIORITY**: Essential for security incident response

The security of our project is a top priority. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

### How to Report

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/azumag/cca-auto-workflows/security) of this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the advisory form with details

2. **Email**
   - Send details to the repository maintainers
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide as much information as possible

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., workflow injection, secrets exposure)
- **Location** of the vulnerability (file, line number, or workflow)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

- **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: Regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: Target resolution within 30 days for high-severity issues

## Security Considerations

### GitHub Actions Security

This project uses GitHub Actions workflows which have specific security considerations:

#### Workflow Permissions üü† HIGH

> üîí **HIGH PRIORITY**: Important for production security - prevents privilege escalation attacks

- All workflows use minimal required permissions
- `permissions` blocks are explicitly defined
- Sensitive operations require elevated permissions

#### Secret Management üî¥ CRITICAL

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRIORITY**: Token security is essential for preventing unauthorized access

- Repository secrets are used for sensitive data
- Personal Access Tokens have minimal required scopes
- Secrets are never logged or exposed in workflow outputs

#### Third-Party Actions üü† HIGH

> üîí **HIGH PRIORITY**: Prevents supply chain attacks and malicious code injection

- We use pinned versions of third-party actions
- Actions are regularly reviewed for security updates
- Only trusted and well-maintained actions are used

### Claude Code Integration

#### API Security üî¥ CRITICAL

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRIORITY**: Secure API communication prevents data breaches

- Claude Code OAuth tokens are stored as repository secrets
- API calls are made over HTTPS
- Rate limiting is respected to prevent abuse

#### Code Execution üü† HIGH

> üîí **HIGH PRIORITY**: Maintains security boundaries

- Claude Code executes with limited permissions
- File system access is restricted to the repository
- Network access is limited to necessary APIs

### Dependency Security üü† HIGH

> üîí **HIGH PRIORITY**: Critical for vulnerability management

#### Automated Scanning üü° MEDIUM

> üìã **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Recommended best practice for ongoing security - enables proactive vulnerability detection

- Trivy vulnerability scanner runs on all changes
- SARIF reports are uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Dependencies are regularly updated

#### Monitoring üü° MEDIUM

> üìã **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Enhances security visibility and incident response capabilities

- Automated security alerts for dependencies
- Regular security audits of the codebase
- Continuous monitoring for new vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices üü† HIGH

> üîí **HIGH PRIORITY**: Essential practices for secure development

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets or credentials**
   - Use `.gitignore` for sensitive files
   - Use repository secrets for tokens and keys
   - Scan commits before pushing with tools like `git-secrets`

2. **Validate inputs in workflows**
   - Sanitize user inputs in workflow parameters
   - Use shell escaping for dynamic values: `${{ github.event.inputs.value }}`
   - Avoid eval-style operations and direct string interpolation

3. **Follow least privilege principle**
   - Request minimal required permissions in workflow `permissions:` blocks
   - Limit scope of access tokens to specific repositories/resources
   - Use specific branch protections rather than broad access

4. **Review workflow changes carefully**
   - Check for injection vulnerabilities (especially in `run:` blocks)
   - Verify third-party action versions are pinned to specific commits
   - Test changes in forks first to avoid production impact

### For Users

1. **Keep your environment secure**
   - Use strong passwords and 2FA
   - Keep your local Git installation updated
   - Use signed commits when possible

2. **Review permissions carefully**
   - Understand what permissions workflows request
   - Monitor repository access logs
   - Report suspicious activity

3. **Use secure authentication**
   - Use GitHub Apps instead of PATs when possible
   - Rotate tokens regularly
   - Limit token scopes

## Known Security Limitations üîµ LOW

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **LOW PRIORITY**: Important awareness items that don't block implementation but require understanding

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **LOW PRIORITY**: Important awareness, but not blocking

### GitHub Actions Limitations

1. **Workflow Modification Restrictions**
   - GitHub Apps cannot modify workflow files without explicit permission
   - This is a security feature, not a bug
   - Manual review required for workflow changes

2. **Fork Restrictions**
   - Some workflows may not work in forks due to secret access
   - This is intentional for security
   - Use `continue-on-error` for fork compatibility

### Claude Code Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits**
   - Claude API has usage limits
   - May affect availability during high usage
   - Not a security issue but worth noting

2. **Generated Code Review**
   - All AI-generated code requires human review before merging
   - May introduce unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities
   - Human oversight is mandatory for production deployments
