# Security Advanced Configuration

## GitHub Actions Security

### Workflow Permissions - HIGH

> **HIGH PRIORITY**: Important for production security - prevents privilege escalation attacks

- All workflows use minimal required permissions
- `permissions` blocks are explicitly defined
- Sensitive operations require elevated permissions

### Secret Management - CRITICAL

> **CRITICAL PRIORITY**: Token security is essential for preventing unauthorized access

- Repository secrets are used for sensitive data
- Personal Access Tokens have minimal required scopes
- Secrets are never logged or exposed in workflow outputs

### Third-Party Actions - HIGH

> **HIGH PRIORITY**: Prevents supply chain attacks and malicious code injection

- We use pinned versions of third-party actions
- Actions are regularly reviewed for security updates
- Only trusted and well-maintained actions are used

## Claude Code Integration

### API Security - CRITICAL

> **CRITICAL PRIORITY**: Secure API communication prevents data breaches

- Claude Code OAuth tokens are stored as repository secrets
- API calls are made over HTTPS
- Rate limiting is respected to prevent abuse

### Code Execution - HIGH

> **HIGH PRIORITY**: Maintains security boundaries

- Claude Code executes with limited permissions
- File system access is restricted to the repository
- Network access is limited to necessary APIs

## Dependency Security - HIGH

> **HIGH PRIORITY**: Critical for vulnerability management

### Automated Scanning - MEDIUM

> **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Recommended best practice for ongoing security - enables proactive vulnerability detection

- Trivy vulnerability scanner runs on all changes
- SARIF reports are uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Dependencies are regularly updated

### Monitoring - MEDIUM

> **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Enhances security visibility and incident response capabilities

- Automated security alerts for dependencies
- Regular security audits of the codebase
- Continuous monitoring for new vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices - HIGH

> **HIGH PRIORITY**: Essential practices for secure development

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets or credentials**
   - Use `.gitignore` for sensitive files
   - Use repository secrets for tokens and keys
   - Scan commits before pushing with tools like `git-secrets`

2. **Validate inputs in workflows**
   - Sanitize user inputs in workflow parameters
   - Use shell escaping for dynamic values: `${{ github.event.inputs.value }}`
   - Avoid eval-style operations and direct string interpolation

3. **Follow least privilege principle**
   - Request minimal required permissions in workflow `permissions:` blocks
   - Limit scope of access tokens to specific repositories/resources
   - Use specific branch protections rather than broad access

4. **Review workflow changes carefully**
   - Check for injection vulnerabilities (especially in `run:` blocks)
   - Verify third-party action versions are pinned to specific commits
   - Test changes in forks first to avoid production impact

### For Users

1. **Keep your environment secure**
   - Use strong passwords and 2FA
   - Keep your local Git installation updated
   - Use signed commits when possible

2. **Review permissions carefully**
   - Understand what permissions workflows request
   - Monitor repository access logs
   - Report suspicious activity

3. **Use secure authentication**
   - Use GitHub Apps instead of PATs when possible
   - Rotate tokens regularly
   - Limit token scopes

## Priority-Based Implementation

### Phase 1: Critical Security (Days 1-2)
**CRITICAL** items must be completed before production:
- Set up vulnerability reporting process
- Implement token and secret management
- Configure API security with HTTPS and proper authentication
- Review and secure all repository secrets

### Phase 2: High Priority Security (Week 1)
**HIGH** priority items for production-ready security:
- **Configure minimal workflow permissions**
  - Review each workflow's `permissions:` block
  - Remove unnecessary permissions like `write-all`
  - Document required permissions in workflow comments
- **Audit and pin third-party action versions**
  - Pin all actions to specific commit SHAs
  - Review action source code for security issues
  - Set up Dependabot for action updates
- **Set up dependency security scanning**
  - Enable GitHub security alerts
  - Configure automated security updates
  - Implement SARIF reporting for vulnerabilities
- **Implement code execution security boundaries**
  - Restrict file system access to repository only
  - Limit network access to necessary APIs
  - Use containerized execution where possible
- **Establish security best practices for contributors**
  - Create security guidelines document
  - Set up pre-commit hooks for secret scanning
  - Require security review for sensitive changes

### Phase 3: Enhanced Security (Week 2-3)
**MEDIUM** priority items for comprehensive security:
- Set up automated vulnerability scanning
- Implement security monitoring and alerting
- Establish security update processes
- Configure additional security tools

### Phase 4: Complete Security Posture (Month 1)
**LOW** priority items for full compliance:
- Document compliance with security standards
- Address known limitations where possible
- Complete security tool integration
- Finalize documentation and contact processes

## Security Tools - MEDIUM

> **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Supporting tools for security implementation

### Automated Tools

- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security Alerts**: Dependency monitoring
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis (when applicable)
- **Secret Scanning**: GitHub native secret detection

### Manual Reviews

- Code review process for all changes
- Security-focused reviews for sensitive changes
- Regular audit of permissions and access

## Compliance and Standards - LOW

> **LOW PRIORITY**: Reference information for security standards and compliance requirements

### Standards Followed

- GitHub Security Best Practices
- OWASP Top 10 considerations
- Principle of least privilege
- Defense in depth

### Regular Reviews

- Monthly security review of workflows
- Quarterly dependency updates
- Annual comprehensive security audit

## Known Security Limitations - LOW

> **LOW PRIORITY**: Important awareness items that don't block implementation but require understanding

### GitHub Actions Limitations

1. **Workflow Modification Restrictions**
   - GitHub Apps cannot modify workflow files without explicit permission
   - This is a security feature, not a bug
   - Manual review required for workflow changes

2. **Fork Restrictions**
   - Some workflows may not work in forks due to secret access
   - This is intentional for security
   - Use `continue-on-error` for fork compatibility

### Claude Code Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits**
   - Claude API has usage limits
   - May affect availability during high usage
   - Not a security issue but worth noting

2. **Generated Code Review**
   - All AI-generated code requires human review before merging
   - May introduce unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities
   - Human oversight is mandatory for production deployments
