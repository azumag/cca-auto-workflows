# Security Incident Response

## Vulnerability Reporting Process

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: Regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: Target resolution within 30 days for high-severity issues

### How to Report

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/azumag/cca-auto-workflows/security) of this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the advisory form with details

2. **Email**
   - Send details to the repository maintainers
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide as much information as possible

### What to Include in Reports

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., workflow injection, secrets exposure)
- **Location** of the vulnerability (file, line number, or workflow)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

## Security Updates - MEDIUM

> **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Important process information

### Notification Process

- Security updates are announced in release notes
- Critical vulnerabilities are communicated via GitHub Security Advisories
- Subscribers to the repository will be notified

### Update Timeline

- **Critical**: Within 24 hours
- **High**: Within 72 hours
- **Medium**: Within 1 week
- **Low**: Next regular release

## Incident Response Procedures

### Initial Response (First 48 Hours)

1. **Acknowledge Receipt**
   - Confirm receipt of vulnerability report
   - Assign severity level
   - Create internal tracking issue

2. **Initial Assessment**
   - Evaluate impact and scope
   - Determine if immediate action is required
   - Notify relevant team members

3. **Communication**
   - Update reporter with acknowledgment
   - Internal team notification
   - Prepare initial response plan

### Investigation Phase (Days 3-5)

1. **Technical Analysis**
   - Reproduce the vulnerability
   - Assess full impact
   - Identify affected systems and users

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Determine severity score
   - Evaluate potential for exploitation
   - Assess business impact

3. **Response Planning**
   - Develop mitigation strategy
   - Create deployment plan
   - Prepare user communications

### Resolution Phase (Days 6-30)

1. **Fix Development**
   - Develop and test fixes
   - Security review of changes
   - Prepare release packages

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy fixes to production
   - Monitor for issues
   - Verify fix effectiveness

3. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Publish security advisory
   - Update documentation

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Vulnerability Response

For vulnerabilities with **Critical** severity:

1. **Immediate Actions (Within 4 Hours)**
   - Emergency team assembly
   - Threat assessment
   - Immediate containment if possible

2. **Short-term Response (Within 24 Hours)**
   - Develop emergency fix
   - Prepare emergency release
   - Communication to critical stakeholders

3. **Follow-up (Within 72 Hours)**
   - Deploy comprehensive fix
   - Public disclosure preparation
   - Post-incident review

### Security Incident Escalation

**Level 1**: Repository maintainers
**Level 2**: Organization security team
**Level 3**: External security experts

Escalation criteria:
- Impact on critical systems
- Potential data exposure
- Active exploitation detected
- Resource limitations

## Failure Scenarios and Mitigation

### Scenario 1: Secrets Exposure

**Risk**: API keys or tokens exposed in repository

**Detection**:
- GitHub secret scanning alerts
- Manual code review findings
- User reports

**Response**:
1. Immediately revoke exposed credentials
2. Remove from git history (if recent)
3. Update all affected systems
4. Audit for unauthorized access
5. Implement additional scanning

### Scenario 2: Workflow Injection

**Risk**: Malicious code execution through workflow manipulation

**Detection**:
- Unusual workflow behavior
- Unexpected resource usage
- Security tool alerts

**Response**:
1. Disable affected workflows
2. Review recent changes
3. Audit workflow permissions
4. Implement input validation
5. Update security guidelines

### Scenario 3: Dependency Compromise

**Risk**: Compromised third-party dependencies

**Detection**:
- Security scanning alerts
- Unexpected application behavior
- Public vulnerability reports

**Response**:
1. Assess impact scope
2. Update or remove dependencies
3. Scan for indicators of compromise
4. Update security scanning rules
5. Review dependency management practices

### Scenario 4: Unauthorized Access

**Risk**: Compromised user accounts or elevated permissions

**Detection**:
- Unusual access patterns
- Unauthorized changes
- User reports

**Response**:
1. Disable compromised accounts
2. Audit recent actions
3. Reset credentials
4. Review access controls
5. Implement additional monitoring
